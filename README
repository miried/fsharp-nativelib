Basic code for F# library which exports two functions "add" and "write_line".
Based on the idea of https://secanablog.wordpress.com/2020/02/01/writing-a-native-library-in-f-which-can-be-called-from-c/ but updated to NativeAOT.


Compile with

dotnet publish /p:NativeLib=Shared /p:SelfContained=true -r [platform] -c release

where [platform] is win-x64, linux-x64, or osx-x64.

To test the library, compile the example C code in main.c
